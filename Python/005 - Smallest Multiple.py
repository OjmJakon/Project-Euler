#Problem: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smalest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

#Code:
#The plan is to create a for loop that iterates through numbers and tests if each number is divisible from 1 to 20 without leaving any remainder. When it finds this number, it exits the loop.
