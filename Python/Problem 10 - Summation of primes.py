#Problem:
#The sum of primes below 10 is 2+3+5+7=17
#Find the sum of all primes below two million

#Code:
#arr=[]
#for i in range(2,2000000):
        #for j in range (2,i):
            #if i % j == 0:
                #break
        #else:
            #arr.append(i)
#print(sum(arr))

#Takes too long. Upon further research it is better to use the Sieve algorithm.
